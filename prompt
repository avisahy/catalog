⭐ ULTIMATE PWA PROMPT (FULL FEATURE SET — RESPONSIVE, ALL PLATFORMS)
Create a fully functional Progressive Web App (PWA) that runs entirely on GitHub Pages at:
https://avisahy.github.io/catalog

The app must use only static files supported by GitHub Pages:

HTML

CSS

JavaScript

JSON

Images (PNG, JPG, SVG, WebP)

Manifest file

Service worker

No backend, no frameworks, no build tools.

The app should be fully responsive and work smoothly across all platforms (mobile, tablet, and desktop), with a mobile‑first design that scales gracefully up to large screens.

🎯 App Purpose
A simple, offline‑capable catalog where each item includes:

Image

Name

Location

🖼 UI & UX Requirements
Modern 3D‑style interface using CSS transforms, depth, shadows, and card tilt

Fully responsive layout that adapts to:

Small phones

Large phones

Tablets

Laptops

Desktop / widescreen

Mobile‑first design, but optimized for keyboard/mouse on desktop as well

Floating Action Button (FAB) for adding items

Smooth transitions and micro‑animations

Toggle switch for Dark / Light mode (persistent)

Clean, minimal, intuitive design

Navigation
The site icon/logo at the top must always link back to the home page.

Animated Page Transitions (NEW)
Smooth fade/slide transitions between:

Tapping an item opens a full preview modal/page showing:

Location

Favorite toggle

Export button

Share via WhatsApp

Share via QR code

Share preview link

Delete button

Swipe Navigation
Inside the item preview, the user can swipe left or right to move between items (on touch devices).

On desktop, arrow buttons or keyboard arrows should allow navigation as well (responsive to input method).

Swipe Exit Behavior
When exiting preview:

Automatically scroll back to the exact item viewed

Briefly highlight it (glow/pulse)

Image Interaction
Pinch‑to‑Zoom inside preview (on touch devices)

Double‑click or tap to toggle a full‑screen image mode

Loading Experience
Skeleton loading animation while items load

Lazy loading images (load only when visible)

Customization
Text size control: small / medium / large

Custom home screen layout: 2‑column, 3‑column, 4‑column

Layout must adapt responsively to screen width (e.g., 2 columns on mobile, 4 on desktop)

Custom themes: user‑selectable color themes

📦 Data & Storage Requirements
Use IndexedDB for structured offline storage.

Export Requirements
Export the entire database to a .json file.
Export individual items to a .json file.

Unique ID

Image data or reference

SHA‑256 checksum

Import Requirements
Import a .json file containing items.

User must be able to choose:

Merge all

Replace all

Select individual items to import

Duplicate Prevention
A duplicate is defined as an item with the same:

name (case‑insensitive)

location (case‑insensitive)

AND identical SHA‑256 checksum

Conflict Resolution Dialog
If a duplicate is detected, show options:

Keep existing

Skip

Tamper Detection (NEW)
If the imported JSON file was manually modified or corrupted:
